It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (like neurons) that process information. The network learns patterns from examples by adjusting the strength of connections between nodes. It's like teaching a child - you show many examples, and over time, the network learns to recognize patterns and make predictions on new data it hasn't seen before."}

Learn the basics: variables, data types, loops, and conditionals\n3. Practice with small projects and coding challenges\n4. Build something you're interested in\n5. Read other people's code to learn different approaches\n6. Join coding communities and don't be afraid to ask questions\n7. Be patient - programming takes time to master, but gets easier with practice\n\nThe key is consistent practice and building real projects, not just following tutorials."}

Machine Learning is a subset of AI - it's a specific approach where machines learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.\n\nThink of it this way:\n- AI is the goal (creating intelligent machines)\n- Machine Learning is one method to achieve that goal (learning from data)\n\nFor example, a chatbot using pre-written rules is AI, but a chatbot that learns from conversations is using Machine Learning."}
